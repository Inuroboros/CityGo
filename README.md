Project information

The platform is a social network for the development of knowledge about the city, by passing tests and puzzles through locations with an interesting story. The aim of each user is to get a prize after completing such a test, a thirst to solve the puzzle and get to know the city better and have more knowledge about it. The aim of the company is to attract advertising through our platform, thanks to a non-trivial way to attract the audience. Its mission is to introduce people to beautiful places, cultural, historical, and architectural attractions of the city (through puzzles and quests), as well as city services (stores, cafes, restaurants).
